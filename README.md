# Transparent Fragments Contour Estimation via Visualâ€“Tactile Fusion for Autonomous Reassembly

# Automated Batch Generation of Synthetic Dataset in Blender

Blender provides powerful visual simulation capabilities through physically-based rendering (PBR) and material reflection/refraction, producing results that closely mimic real-world interactions between light and materials. 

**Transparent objects**, being a special category, have refractive and transmissive material properties that make their visual features highly sensitive to environmental lighting and background. In real-world scenarios, collecting data of transparent objects with diverse backgrounds and lighting conditions is challenging, and annotations are prone to errors due to difficulties in recognition.

This project offers a Blender script for the **automated generation of synthetic datasets** containing transparent objects. Before each render, the scripts randomize scene elements, including background, lighting and camera angle, greatly enhancing the diversity and richness of the dataset. Using **ID masks**, accurate segmentation masks can be generated. The script supports batch dataset generation with **any scene in which objects are placed at a horizontal plane**. For implementation details, please refer to the [Automated_Batch_Generation_of_Synthetic_Datasets_in_Blender](https://github.com/Keithllin/Transparent-Fragments-Contour-Estimation/tree/main/Automated_Batch_Generation_of_Synthetic_Datasets_in_Blender)

## TransFrag27K Dataset

This script was used to create **the first large-scale transparent fragment dataset, TransFrag27K**, which contains **27,000 images and masks** at a resolution of 640Ã—480. 
The dataset covers **fragments of common everyday glassware** and incorporates more than **150 background textures** and **100 HDRI environment lightings**.  

ðŸ“¥ **Download:** The dataset [TransFrag27K on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chenbr7/TransFrag27K) is available to download.
